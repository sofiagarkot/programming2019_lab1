This module is created for discovering the places on the map depending on the year, that user had typed.

The resulting file - Sofia.html is a map with 4 layers. The user can manage which of the layers to display.

The first layer is the map itself.

The second layer is colored countries depending on the population.
All of the countries are colored in green, orange or red colors: if the population is more than 20000000 the color is red; if the population is between 10000000 and 20000000 - orange, and if the population is less than 10000000 - green.

The third layer is the blue markers, that show the places where certain movies were being filmed. Notice that for reducing working time, there are only 500 of them. 
Clicking on it the user can find out the name of the film, that was filmed in some place.

The fourth layer is presented by circle markers. With circle markers are marked the areas, where several films were filmed.
Clicking on the circle marker user can see the number of films, that was filmed in some area. Circle marker is red if on the location were filmed more than 20 movies; yellow if the number of movies is between 5 and 20, and green if the number is less than 5.

Notice that for reducing the working time of the program there are only 1000 points on the map.
While working with module user will be asked to enter the year, when he or she wants to find out locations of movies.

!DOCTYPE html - this tag is document type declaration. It is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

head - The head element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the html tag and the body tag.

The http-equiv attribute provides an HTTP header for the information/value of the content attribute; content - gives the value associated with the http-equiv or name attribute; charset=UTF-8 is a character encoding.
